I am exploring event driven programming approach in python. 
Why?
1. It helps keep the dependencies loosely tied. 
2. It helps to test event handlers separately from the main code. 
3. Multiple dependencies can be added easily to same event handler. 
4. Document and Logs classes can be initialized separately 
5. Add logging in and out of the handlers
