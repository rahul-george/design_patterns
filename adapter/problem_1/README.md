## ðŸ§© Customer Data Import Adapter

Your application uses a standardized Customer class to manage customer data. However, you receive customer data from multiple third-party vendors in different formatsâ€”CSV, JSON, XML, and even custom APIs. Your task is to:

- Design a flexible system that can import and normalize customer data from all these sources.
- Use the Adapter Design Pattern to convert each format into your standardized Customer object.
- Ensure the system is extensible, so new formats can be added with minimal changes.
